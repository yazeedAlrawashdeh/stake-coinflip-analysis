# 🎲 Stake Flip Analyzer

A community-driven browser-based project to **track and analyze the fairness of the coin flip game on [Stakes.com](https://stakes.com)**.

We aim to:
- Collect real coin flip data from Stakes.com
- Visualize outcomes and trends
- Test for potential bias or unfair patterns
- Build a public, transparent record of coin flip results

## 🧪 Why This Project?

Online casinos claim to use fair random number generators (RNGs) — but how fair is "fair"? We're collecting real data to put that to the test.

If you're interested in data analysis, statistics, browser scripting, or fairness in online games, we welcome your help!
