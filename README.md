#  Stake Flip Analyzer

I'm no expert, I'm looking forward to collaborating with you where we can share ideas and potentially work it out.

A community-driven browser-based project to **track and analyze the fairness of the coin flip game on [Stake.com](https://stake.com)**.

We aim to:
- Collect real coin flip data from Stakes.com
- Visualize outcomes and trends
- Test for potential bias or unfair patterns
- Build a public, transparent record of coin flip results

##  Why This Project?

Online casinos claim to use fair random number generators (RNGs) — but how fair is "fair"? We're collecting real data to put that to the test.

If you're interested in data analysis, statistics, browser scripting, or fairness in online games, we welcome your help!

---

##  Getting Started

This project runs entirely in the **browser** — no Python or installations required.

### Step 1: Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yazeedAlrawashdeh/stake-coinflip-analysis.git
```

### Step 2: Open `index.html` in your browser

Start logging flip outcomes, and contribute your findings!

### Statistical Methods for Detecting Bias

1. Frequentist Analysis: Binomial Proportion Test
Objective: Determine if the proportion of heads deviates significantly from 50%.

Method: Conduct a binomial test or calculate confidence intervals for the observed proportion.

Considerations: Ensure a sufficiently large sample size to detect small biases with statistical power.

2. Bayesian Inference
Objective: Estimate the probability distribution of the coin's bias.

Method: Apply Bayes' theorem to update beliefs about the bias after observing data.

Tools: Utilize Beta distributions as conjugate priors for binomial likelihoods. 

3. Sequential Analysis
Objective: Monitor coin flips in real-time to detect emerging biases.

Method: Implement sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) to decide when to stop sampling.

Application: Useful for ongoing monitoring during gameplay sessions.

### Machine Learning Techniques
1. Anomaly Detection
Objective: Identify unusual patterns in the sequence of flips.

Methods:

Isolation Forests: Detect outliers by isolating observations.

Autoencoders: Learn a compressed representation of data and identify reconstruction errors.

Application: Flag sequences that deviate from expected randomness

2. Predictive Modeling
Objective: Predict the outcome of the next flip based on historical data.

Methods:

Logistic Regression: Model the probability of heads as a function of previous outcomes.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Capture temporal dependencies in flip sequences.

Considerations: While these models can identify patterns, they should not be used to predict future outcomes in games designed to be random.

3. Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods
Objective: Simulate coin flips to understand expected distributions and detect anomalies.

Method: Generate a large number of simulated flips and compare the observed data to these simulations.

Tools: Python's random module or libraries like NumPy for simulations.


### Cognitive Biases to Consider
Understanding human psychology can also play a role in analyzing coin flip games:

Gambler's Fallacy: The belief that past independent events influence future outcomes.

Recency Bias: The tendency to give undue weight to recent events.

Confirmation Bias: The inclination to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.


### Visualizing the Data
Effective visualization can reveal patterns and anomalies:

Histograms: Show the distribution of heads and tails.

Time Series Plots: Display the sequence of outcomes over time.

Heatmaps: Illustrate the frequency of consecutive outcomes.

### Implementing the Analysis
To begin your analysis:

Data Collection: Use browser automation tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to collect flip data from Stakes.com.

Data Storage: Store the collected data in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV.

Analysis: Apply the statistical and machine learning methods outlined above.

Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to identify patterns.
